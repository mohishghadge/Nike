# My Nike App

This is a responsive web application built with React, featuring a collapsible hamburger menu for navigation, deployed on Netlify. Below is an outline of the key features.

## Features

### 1. **Responsive Hamburger Menu**
   - A responsive hamburger menu is implemented using React.
   - The menu opens and closes based on the user's interaction, enhancing the mobile experience.
   - On desktop, the menu adapts to a standard navbar, while on mobile, it collapses into a hamburger icon for space optimization.
   - CSS transitions are used to create a smooth open/close animation for the menu.

### 2. **Routing**
   - The app uses React Router for efficient page navigation.
   - Dynamic loading of pages without reloading the full site.
   - Routes are defined for key sections like `Home`, `About`, and `Contact`.

### 3. **State Management**
   - Utilized `useState` for managing the state of the hamburger menu (open/closed).
   - Prop drilling is minimized by efficiently passing state across components.

### 4. **Responsive Design**
   - The app is fully responsive across different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
   - Media queries are employed to ensure the UI adjusts smoothly to varying screen sizes.

### 5. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - The project is structured in reusable React components for scalability and maintainability.
   - Key components include: `Navbar`, `HamburgerMenu`, `Header`, and `Footer`.

### 6. **Animations**
   - Smooth animations added to enhance user experience.
   - CSS transitions provide fluid effects for opening/closing the hamburger menu.

### 7. **Deployment**
   - The project is deployed on Netlify for seamless hosting and easy CI/CD integration.
